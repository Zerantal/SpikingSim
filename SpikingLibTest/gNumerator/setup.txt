Install Notes

This is the second release of the mathml dom and mathml rendering
components, there is no true install yet. There are only 2 steps 
to set up the rendering component, and the other mathml dom component 
needs no setup.

1: copy the font files (math-roman.ttf and cm-stretchy.ttf) into your
   font folder. The rendering component needs these fonts in order to
   work properly.

2: The renderer needs to know the location of the font config files.
   You may specify the location of these (font-configuration-*.xml) 
   by setting the value of the "mathml-rendering-config" property
   in the MathML.Rendering.Test1.exe.config file. If this value is not
   set, the renderer will look in the current directory for these files.

* note - the font cm-roman.ttf is no longer used, and may be deleted.
  It will however do no harm if left alone.
